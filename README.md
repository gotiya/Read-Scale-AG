# Read-Scale-AG
First try at creating a Read Scale 2 node SQL Server 2017 Availability Group containers on same Win host 

13/09/2018 - For some reason the last step of restoring the db on secondary runs successfully from Master.ps1 but when logged-in via SSMS into the secondary replica the databases does not show up and neither the database has joined the availablity group.
